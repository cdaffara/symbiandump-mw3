ACT V

SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.

   Enter Helena, Widow, and Diana, with two Attendants

   Helena

   But this exceeding posting day and night
   Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
   But since you have made the days and nights as one,
   To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
   Be bold you do so grow in my requital
   As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

   Enter a Gentleman

   This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
   If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

   Gentleman

   And you.

   Helena

   Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

   Gentleman

   I have been sometimes there.

   Helena

   I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
   From the report that goes upon your goodness;
   An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
   Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
   The use of your own virtues, for the which
   I shall continue thankful.

   Gentleman

   What's your will?

   Helena

   That it will please you
   To give this poor petition to the king,
   And aid me with that store of power you have
   To come into his presence.

   Gentleman

   The king's not here.

   Helena

   Not here, sir!

   Gentleman

   Not, indeed:
   He hence removed last night and with more haste
   Than is his use.

   Widow

     Lord, how we lose our pains!

   Helena

   All's well that ends well yet,
   Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
   I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

   Gentleman

   Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
   Whither I am going.

   Helena

   I do beseech you, sir,
   Since you are like to see the king before me,
   Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
   Which I presume shall render you no blame
   But rather make you thank your pains for it.
   I will come after you with what good speed
   Our means will make us means.

   Gentleman

   This I'll do for you.

   Helena

   And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
   Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
   Go, go, provide.

   Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the Count's palace.

   Enter Clown, and Parolles, following

   Parolles

   Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter: I have ere now,
   sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with
   fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's mood, and
   smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.

   Clown

   Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly
   as thou speakest of: I will henceforth eat no fish of fortune's
   buttering. Prithee, allow the wind.

   Parolles

   Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by a metaphor.

   Clown

   Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against
   any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.

   Parolles

   Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

   Clown

   Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's close-stool to give to
   a nobleman! Look, here he comes himself.

   Enter Lafeu

   Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's cat,--but not a
   musk-cat,--that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her
   displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
   carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish,
   rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort and
   leave him to your lordship.

   Exit

   Parolles

   My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.

   Lafeu

   And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her nails now.
   Wherein have you played the knave with fortune, that she should scratch
   you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive
   long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for you: let the justices make
   you and fortune friends: I am for other business.

   Parolles

   I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.

   Lafeu

   You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't; save your word.

   Parolles

   My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

   Lafeu

   You beg more than `word,' then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How
   does your drum?

   Parolles

   O my good lord, you were the first that found me!

   Lafeu

   Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.

   Parolles

   It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring
   me out.

   Lafeu

   Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of
   God and the devil? One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee
   out.

   Trumpets sound

   The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further
   after me; I had talk of you last night: though you are a fool and a
   knave, you shall eat; go to, follow.

   Parolles

   I praise God for you.

   Exeunt

SCENE III. Rousillon. The Count's palace.

   Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafeu, the two French Lords, with
   Attendants

   King

   We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
   Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
   As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
   Her estimation home.

   Countess

   'Tis past, my liege;
   And I beseech your majesty to make it
   Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
   When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
   O'erbears it and burns on.

   King

   My honour'd lady,
   I have forgiven and forgotten all;
   Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
   And watch'd the time to shoot.

   Lafeu

   This I must say,
   But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
   Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
   Offence of mighty note; but to himself
   The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
   Whose beauty did astonish the survey
   Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
   Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
   Humbly call'd mistress.

   King

   Praising what is lost
   Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
   We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
   All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
   The nature of his great offence is dead,
   And deeper than oblivion we do bury
   The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
   A stranger, no offender; and inform him
   So 'tis our will he should.

   Gentleman

   I shall, my liege.

   Exit

   King

   What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?

   Lafeu

   All that he is hath reference to your highness.

   King

   Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
   That set him high in fame.

   Enter Bertram

   Lafeu

   He looks well on't.

   King

   I am not a day of season,
   For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
   In me at once: but to the brightest beams
   Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
   The time is fair again.

   Bertram

   My high-repented blames,
   Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

   King

   All is whole;
   Not one word more of the consumed time.
   Let's take the instant by the forward top;
   For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
   The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
   Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
   The daughter of this lord?

   Bertram

   Admiringly, my liege, at first
   I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
   Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
   Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
   Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
   Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
   Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
   Extended or contracted all proportions
   To a most hideous object: thence it came
   That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
   Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
   The dust that did offend it.

   King

   Well excused:
   That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
   From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
   Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
   To the great sender turns a sour offence,
   Crying, `That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
   Make trivial price of serious things we have,
   Not knowing them until we know their grave:
   Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
   Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
   Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
   While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
   Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
   Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
   The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
   To see our widower's second marriage-day.

   Countess

   Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
   Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

   Lafeu

   Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
   Must be digested, give a favour from you
   To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
   That she may quickly come.

   Bertram gives a ring

   By my old beard,
   And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
   Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
   The last that e'er I took her at court,
   I saw upon her finger.

   Bertram

   Hers it was not.

   King

   Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
   While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
   This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
   I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
   Necessitied to help, that by this token
   I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
   her
   Of what should stead her most?

   Bertram

   My gracious sovereign,
   Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
   The ring was never hers.

   Countess

   Son, on my life,
   I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
   At her life's rate.

   Lafeu

   I am sure I saw her wear it.

   Bertram

   You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
   In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
   Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
   Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
   I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
   To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
   I could not answer in that course of honour
   As she had made the overture, she ceased
   In heavy satisfaction and would never
   Receive the ring again.

   King

   Plutus himself,
   That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
   Hath not in nature's mystery more science
   Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
   Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
   That you are well acquainted with yourself,
   Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
   You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
   That she would never put it from her finger,
   Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
   Where you have never come, or sent it us
   Upon her great disaster.

   Bertram

   She never saw it.

   King

   Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
   And makest conjectural fears to come into me
   Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
   That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
   And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
   And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
   Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
   More than to see this ring. Take him away.

   Guards seize Bertram

   My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
   Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
   Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
   We'll sift this matter further.

   Bertram

   If you shall prove
   This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
   Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
   Where yet she never was.

   Exit, guarded

   King

   I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

   Enter a Gentleman

   Gentleman

   Gracious sovereign,
   Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
   Here's a petition from a Florentine,
   Who hath for four or five removes come short
   To tender it herself. I undertook it,
   Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
   Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
   Is here attending: her business looks in her
   With an importing visage; and she told me,
   In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
   Your highness with herself.

   King

   [Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead,
   I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his
   vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He stole from
   Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice:
   grant it me, O king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
   flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
   Diana CAPILET.

   Lafeu

   I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: I'll none of
   him.

   King

   The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
   To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
   Go speedily and bring again the count.
   I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
   Was foully snatch'd.

   Countess

   Now, justice on the doers!

   Re-enter Bertram, guarded

   King

   I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
   And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
   Yet you desire to marry.

   Enter Widow and Diana

   What woman's that?

   Diana

   I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
   Derived from the ancient Capilet:
   My suit, as I do understand, you know,
   And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

   Widow

   I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
   Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
   And both shall cease, without your remedy.

   King

   Come hither, count; do you know these women?

   Bertram

   My lord, I neither can nor will deny
   But that I know them: do they charge me further?

   Diana

   Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

   Bertram

   She's none of mine, my lord.

   Diana

   If you shall marry,
   You give away this hand, and that is mine;
   You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
   You give away myself, which is known mine;
   For I by vow am so embodied yours,
   That she which marries you must marry me,
   Either both or none.

   Lafeu

   Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for
   her.

   Bertram

   My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
   Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
   Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
   Than for to think that I would sink it here.

   King

   Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
   Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
   Than in my thought it lies.

   Diana

   Good my lord,
   Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
   He had not my virginity.

   King

   What say'st thou to her?

   Bertram

   She's impudent, my lord,
   And was a common gamester to the camp.

   Diana

   He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
   He might have bought me at a common price:
   Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
   Whose high respect and rich validity
   Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
   He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
   If I be one.

   Countess

     He blushes, and 'tis it:
   Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
   Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
   Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
   That ring's a thousand proofs.

   King

   Methought you said
   You saw one here in court could witness it.

   Diana

   I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
   So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

   Lafeu

   I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

   King

   Find him, and bring him hither.

   Exit an Attendant

   Bertram

   What of him?
   He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
   With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
   Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
   Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
   That will speak any thing?

   King

   She hath that ring of yours.

   Bertram

   I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
   And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
   She knew her distance and did angle for me,
   Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
   As all impediments in fancy's course
   Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
   Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
   Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
   And I had that which any inferior might
   At market-price have bought.

   Diana

   I must be patient:
   You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
   May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
   Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
   Send for your ring, I will return it home,
   And give me mine again.

   Bertram

   I have it not.

   King

   What ring was yours, I pray you?

   Diana

   Sir, much like
   The same upon your finger.

   King

   Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

   Diana

   And this was it I gave him, being abed.

   King

   The story then goes false, you threw it him
   Out of a casement.

   Diana

     I have spoke the truth.

   Enter Parolles

   Bertram

   My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

   King

   You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
   Is this the man you speak of?

   Diana

   Ay, my lord.

   King

   Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
   Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
   Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
   By him and by this woman here what know you?

   Parolles

   So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman:
   tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.

   King

   Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

   Parolles

   Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

   King

   How, I pray you?

   Parolles

   He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

   King

   How is that?

   Parolles

   He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

   King

   As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this!

   Parolles

   I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

   Lafeu

   He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

   Diana

   Do you know he promised me marriage?

   Parolles

   Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

   King

   But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

   Parolles

   Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more
   than that, he loved her: for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of
   Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I was in that
   credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed, and of
   other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive
   me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.

   King

   Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married:
   but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside.
   This ring, you say, was yours?

   Diana

   Ay, my good lord.

   King

   Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

   Diana

   It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

   King

   Who lent it you?

   Diana

     It was not lent me neither.

   King

   Where did you find it, then?

   Diana

   I found it not.

   King

   If it were yours by none of all these ways,
   How could you give it him?

   Diana

   I never gave it him.

   Lafeu

   This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.

   King

   This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

   Diana

   It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

   King

   Take her away; I do not like her now;
   To prison with her: and away with him.
   Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
   Thou diest within this hour.

   Diana

   I'll never tell you.

   King

   Take her away.

   Diana

     I'll put in bail, my liege.

   King

   I think thee now some common customer.

   Diana

   By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

   King

   Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

   Diana

   Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
   He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
   I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
   Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
   I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

   King

   She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

   Diana

   Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

   Exit Widow

   The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
   And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
   Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
   Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
   He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
   And at that time he got his wife with child:
   Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
   So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
   And now behold the meaning.

   Re-enter Widow, with Helena

   King

   Is there no exorcist
   Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
   Is't real that I see?

   Helena

   No, my good lord;
   'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
   The name and not the thing.

   Bertram

   Both, both. O, pardon!

   Helena

   O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
   I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
   And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
   `When from my finger you can get this ring
   And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:
   Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

   Bertram

   If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
   I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

   Helena

   If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
   Deadly divorce step between me and you!
   O my dear mother, do I see you living?

   Lafeu

   Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

   To Parolles

   Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
   I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
   Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

   King

   Let us from point to point this story know,
   To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

   To Diana

   If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
   Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
   For I can guess that by thy honest aid
   Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
   Of that and all the progress, more or less,
   Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
   All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
   The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
