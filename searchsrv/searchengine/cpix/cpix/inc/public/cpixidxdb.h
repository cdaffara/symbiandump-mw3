/**
 * CPix API for searching.
 *
 * The CPix engine must be initialized before use and shut down
 * afterwards (see. cpixinit.h).
 *
 * Currently, this engine supports only single-threaded access.
 *
 * Short description of lifetime management
 *
 * All the cpix_XXX structs in here are wrappers over native (clucene)
 * classes. Some functions result in creation of new native instances,
 * some other functions merely return reference pointers to existing
 * ones that are owned by some other instance. While the wrappers must
 * be deallocated in both cases, the native instances wrapped by them
 * must be deallocated in one case and must not be deallocated in the
 * other. Obviously, there will have to be two different ways of
 * deallocating wrappers. To make things simple, and also to be able
 * to express intent of lifetime management in function signatures,
 * the following rules are adopted.
 *
 *   (a) Returning C-strings (char*, wchar_t*) will always be
 *       documented if the ownership of the returned string passes to
 *       the caller.
 *
 *   (b) Returning a pointer to a cpix_XXX will always indicate that
 *       the native type and its cpix_XXX wrapper are newly created
 *       instances. In this case, the caller must make sure to clean
 *       them up (both the native and the wrapper) with a call to
 *       cpix_XXX_destroy(...). DO NOT USE free() or delete on these
 *       pointers!
 *
 *   (c) Some functions will take a pointer to an cpix_XXX instance
 *       and fill it up with a pointer to a native instance. This
 *       always indicates that the native instance is not a newly
 *       created one. Therefore, deallocation of such wrappers are not
 *       needed, and cpix_XXX_destroy most not be called. The most
 *       comfortable way to use these functions is to have the
 *       cpix_XXX wrapper instance as a local variable of a function
 *       (i.e. on the stack), and when the variable's lifetime is over
 *       everything will be fine. Of course, a client may create
 *       cpix_XXX instance on the heap too, in which case, it is the
 *       callers responsibility to deallocate the dynamically
 *       allocated cpix_XXX instance with free() or delete (depending
 *       on how it was allocated).
 *
 *
 * CPIX VOCABULARY
 *
 * Application class or "appclass", for short, is simply a string
 * representiation of a type of a document in an index. It has an
 * internal structure expressing hierarchy of those types. The most
 * generic type is "root", and all documents representing files are of
 * the type "root file" or a descendant type of "root file", like
 * "root file usrdoc text". See appclass-hierarchy.txt.
 *
 * Base application class or "baseappclass" is an appclass, that an
 * application / application domain deems significant enough to assign
 * its own application index to it. Like files are stored in an index
 * identified by base app class "root file". It means that ALL
 * documents that go to that index MUST be of the type "root file" or
 * some of its descendant, like "root file usrdoc text".
 *
 * Qualified base app class: an application index, that is a whole
 * conceptually, can be broken down to several physical index
 * databases, called volumes. The usual reason is performance: if you
 * have 10 thousand documents that you don't ever need to update, but
 * there are tens of documents that change frequently, you can
 * organize your application index into two volumes, and only one of
 * them is frequently updated. Such physical index needs sometimes
 * explicit addressing, and this is achieved by qualifying the base
 * app class with a volume id. For instancem, files harvested from the
 * e drive may be stored in a volume identified by qualified base app
 * class "@d:root file", where the volume identifier, 'd', is in the
 * beginning of the string.
 *
 * Unqualified base app class: the same as a (plain) base app class.
 *
 * Domain selector: a non empty, comma-separated list of
 * appclasses. Like "@d:root file,root msg phone sms" domain selector,
 * when gicen to index searcher constructor, will search those two
 * indexes and nothing else.
