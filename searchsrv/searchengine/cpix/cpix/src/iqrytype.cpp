/**
 * This file contains the main logic for query parsing. Sub query
 * types (implementing interface IQrytype) are enumerated here for
 * use.
 *
 * General syntax for queries
 * ==========================
 *
 * A general description of the syntax is found in iqrytype.h.
 *
 *
 * Query types and their syntax / arguments
 * ========================================
 *
 * 1 CLucene query
 * ---------------
 *
 * A query that does not start with either of the tokens '$', '*' is
 * interpreted as a clucene query.
 *
 * A clucene query searches on the field the query parser was
 * constructed with. The clucene query can also be invoked explicitly,
 * using the generic syntax and the 'plain' query type identifier:
 *
 *   '$plain(QRY)'
 *
 * where QRY is the clucene query itself. Therefore '$plain(QRY)' and
 * 'QRY' are equivalent.
 *
 *
 * 2 Dump query
 * ------------
 *
 * A dump query is identified by a single '*' query string or '$dump'
 * using the generic syntax and the query type identifier 'dump'. It
 * does not need any argument and it does not take into account the
 * field with wich the query parser was constructed with. The
 * resulting hits will contain all the documents - hence its name.
 *
 * The dump query can take two additional forms:
 *
 *   '* AND QRY' or '$dump(QRY)'
 *
 * these two have the same meaning, namely, dump all documents that
 * adhere the actual criteria given by QRY. In fact, these are
 * resolved as plain, clucene queries. In other words, these for query
 * syntaxes are equivalent:
 *
 *   'QRY'
 *   '$plain(QRY)'
 *   '* AND QRY'
 *   '$dump(QRY)'
 *
 * The reason dump query is made special by delegating tasks to plain
 * clucene query is that clients may have easier time to construct
 * query strings. For instance, the first term might be a word the
 * user entered or '*' if she entered nothing, and depending on
 * whether there is some extra search criteria (like '_appclass:'root
 * file media jpg') can be concatenated at will. That is, the two
 * parts of a query string can be independently constructed based on
 * two unrelated variables (1: whether the user has entered anything,
 * 2: what context / extra criteria we have).
 *
 *
 *
 * 3 Terms query
 * -------------
 *
 * Uses the field given to query parser, and enumerates all the
 * existing terms on that field that match a pattern. It accepts
 * integer argument in the query strings limiting the number of hits
 * to return and an optional application class prefix argument. 
 * The application class prefix given as a string literal. For example:
 *
 * '$terms<10>(happ*)'
 *
 * Enumerate at most 10 terms that are found in a specific field that
 * start with 'happ'.
 * 
 * Following example queries search for all terms starting with 'beatl'
 * occurring in documents, which base application class begins with 
 * 'root file media' (e.g. 'root file media mp3'). 
 * 
 * '$terms<10, 'root file media'>(beatl*)'
 *
 * NOTE: Enumerating all the terms with a syntax like '$terms<10>(*)'
 * is not supported.
 *
 * NOTE: Other clucene wildcard query syntaxes may be used, like
 *
 * '$terms<10>(happ?)' or '$terms<10>(ha*n)'.
 *
 *
 * 4 Address query
 * ---------------
 *
 * Ignores the field given to query parser, and requires two real
 * (floating point numbers) arguments representing GPS reference point
 * (latitude and longitude) coordinates given in decimal form. The
 * inner query itself is a list of words, processed by the address
 * search logic. Example:
 *
 * '$address<60.1234,23.456>(Mannerheimintie)'
 *
 * the returned results are ordered according to their distance from
 * the given reference point.
 *
 *
 *
 * 5 QNR search
 * ------------
 *
 * Performs a more or less conventional clucene search and tries to
 * find documents, in an ever widening circle, that fall within the
 * vicinity of a given GPS reference point.
 *
 * Prerequisite: the documents must have a QNR field prepared
 * (indevicecfg.h : QNR_FIELD) for this type of search to work. See
 * QUAD_FILTER.
 *
 * Syntax:
 *
 * '$quad<RADIUS,MAXHITCOUNT,RPLAT,RPLONG,CPLAT1,CPLONG1, ...>(QUERY)'.
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *        RADIUS is the maximum radius, in kilometers defining the
 *        vicinity. Actual distance of hits from the reference may be
 *        more, but not significantly. Mandatory argument.
 *
 *        MAXHITCOUNT is the maximym number of hits we are interested
 *        in. The searching that goes on for ever widening areas
 *        terminates when either the readius or the maxhitcount is
 *        exceeded. Mandatory argument.
 *
 *        RPLAT, RPLONG: the GPS coordinates of the reference point,
 *        according to which the hit resuls should be sorted based on
 *        the distance. Mandatory argument.
 *
 *        CPLAT1, CPLONG1: the GPS coordinates for the first center
 *        point around wich hits are being searched for. At least one
 *        pair of floats (GPS coordinate in decimal notation) is
 *        required, can be more, but always in pairs, obviously.
 *
 *        QUERY any clucene-type of query, if any, for some other
 *        fields, etc. Optional.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * '$quad<4.0,10,60.154023,24.887724,0.0,0.0>'
 *
 * will look for at most 10 documents that are not significantly
 * further from the one center point GPS(0.0,0.0) than 4.0
 * kilometers. Any such hits are sorted based on their distance from
 * the reference point GPS(lat:60.154023,long:24.887724).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * '$quad<4.0,10,60.154023,24.887724,0.0,0.0>(pizza)'
 *
 * The same as above, but now it looks for the term pizza in the field
 * specified to the query parser as a default search field.
 * 
 * 
 * 6 Prefix query
 * ------------
 *
 * 
 *
 *   '$Prefix(QRY)'
 *
 * these two have the same meaning, namely, dump all documents that
 * adhere the actual criteria given by QRY. In fact, these are
 * resolved as plain, clucene queries. In other words, these for query
 * syntaxes are equivalent:
 *
 *   '$Prefix(QRY)'
 *
 * The reason dump query is made special by delegating tasks to plain
 * clucene query is that clients may have easier time to construct
 * query strings. For instance, the first term might be a word the
 * user entered or '*' if she entered nothing, and depending on
 * whether there is some extra search criteria (like '_appclass:'root
 * file media jpg') can be concatenated at will. That is, the two
 * parts of a query string can be independently constructed based on
 * two unrelated variables (1: whether the user has entered anything,
 * 2: what context / extra criteria we have).

     *  Set of final states: 2, 6, 9.
     * 
     *  NOTE: The Q token is referred here as it would be a
     *  primitive token, but in fact it is an entire inner query,
     *  which can be possible a full-fledged clucene
     *  query. Obviously, we are not going to write a parser that
     *
     *    o can recognize full clucene query syntax
     * 
     *    o and is flexible to be extended to recognize other
     *      inner query syntaxes (like address search syntax).
     *
     *  Fortunately, there is no need to, with a bit of manual
     *  hack. If the automaton gets to state #7, then basically it
     *  gets very simple and linear: it must read the inner query,
     *  then a right parenthesis, and then the input stream must
     *  end. So, in practice, in state #7, we will
     *
     *    o search for the right parenthesis (if none found, issue
     *      error)
     *
     *    o and say that anything between the left and right
     *      parentheses is Q, the inner query.
     *
     *  Therefore, there is not even going to be a state #8 and #9
     *  declared, and state #7 shall be handled exceptionally.
     *
     *  NOTE Actually, some other states need special handling to
     *  retrieve the value of the identifiers and literals during
     *  parsing. For instance, during state transition (#1,I)->#2
